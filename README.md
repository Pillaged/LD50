MVP TODO:
1. Player Character: Movement, lose on taking hit.
2. Terrain: Collision and finish block. No design just yet.
3. Time Orb: Instantiated by player, interact with enemies
4. Enemies: Movement script (back and forth b/t 2 points, pathfinding?), shoot PC when in vision cone. Slow down upon interaction with Time Orb.
